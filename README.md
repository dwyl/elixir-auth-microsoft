# _Why_? ü§∑

Following 
[`Google`](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-google)
and 
[`Github`](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-github)
it made sense for us 
to add "**Sign-in with _Microsoft_**". <br />
This is the package 
we _wished_ already existed.
Now it does!

# _What_? üí≠

An **`Elixir`** package that seamlessly handles
Microsoft OAuth2 Authentication/Authorization
in the fewest steps. <br />
Following best practices for security & privacy
and avoiding complexity
by having sensible defaults for all settings.


> We built a lightweight solution
that does **_one_ thing**
and is _easy_ for complete beginners to understand/use. <br />
There were already a few available options
for adding Microsoft Auth on
[**hex.pm**/packages?**search=microsoft**](https://hex.pm/packages?search=microsoft). 
Most of these are not specific to Azure AD or build upon other auth packages
that have much more implementation steps and complexity. 
**Complexity == Cost**. üí∏
Both to onboard new devs and maintain your app when there are updates. </br>
This package is the simplest implementation we could conceive. 
It has _both_ **step-by-step setup instructions**
and a **_complete_ working example `Phoenix` App**.
See: 
[**/demo**](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-microsoft/blob/main/demo)


# _Who_? üë•

This package is for people building apps 
with **`Elixir`** / **`Phoenix`**
who want to add "**Sign-in with Microsoft**" 
_much faster_
and more maintainably.

It's targetted at **_complete_ beginners**
with no prior experience/knowledge
of auth "schemes" or "strategies". <br />
Just follow the detailed instructions
and you'll be up-and running in a few minutes.


# _How_? ‚úÖ

You can add Microsoft Authentication to your **`Elixir`** App
using **`elixir_auth_microsoft`** <br />
in under **5 minutes** the following steps.

## 1. Add the hex package to `deps` üì¶

Open your project's **`mix.exs`** file
and locate the **`deps`** (dependencies) section. <br />
Add a line for **`:elixir_auth_microsoft`** in the **`deps`** list:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:elixir_auth_microsoft, "~> 1.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Once you have added the line to your **`mix.exs`**,
remember to run the **`mix deps.get`** command
in your terminal
to _download_ the dependencies.


## 2. Create an App Registration in Azure Active Directory üÜï

Create an App in Azure Active Directory 
if you already don't have one. <br/>
You need this to generate
OAuth2 credentials for the appication. 

The Azure AD credentials 
can _either_ be saved as environment variables
or stored in a config file if you prefer.

> **Note**: There are a few steps for creating your
Azure App Registration and respective credentials. <br />
We created the following 
[`azure_app_registration_guide.md`](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-microsoft/blob/main/azure_app_registration_guide.md)
to make it quick and painless.<br />
Don't be intimidated by all the buzz-words;
it's quite straightforward. <br />
> Once you have followed the instructions in the guide 
you will have the two secrets you need to proceed. <br />
> If you get stuck, 
[**get _help_ by opening an issue on GitHub!**](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-microsoft/issues) <br />


## 3. Export Environment / Application Variables

You may either export these 
as environment variables 
or store them as application secrets:

e.g:

```sh
export MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET=rDq8Q~.uc-237FryAt-lGu7G1sQkKR
export MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=85228de4-cf4f-4249-ae05-247365
export MICROSOFT_SCOPES_LIST=openid profile 
```

> **Note**: These keys aren't valid, 
> they are just for illustration purposes.

***alternatively*** add the following lines to your
`config/runtime.exs` file:

```elixir
config :elixir_auth_microsoft,
  client_id: "00c63f7-6da6-43bd-a94f-74d36486264a",
  client_secret: "paX8Q~_SRO9~UScMi4GTyw.oC8U_De.MiqDX~dBO"
  scopes: "openid profile"
```

See: https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html#handling-of-your-application-secrets

The `MICROSOFT_SCOPES_LIST` or `scopes` are **optional**, 
and they default to the user `profile`. <br />
For the scopes available, see:
[learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html#handling-of-your-application-secrets)

Remember that the scopes you request 
are only given permission depending 
on what you set in the App Registration 
in Azure Active Directory.
Find more information in the 
[`azure_app_registration_guide.md`](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-microsoft/blob/main/azure_app_registration_guide.md)

### A note on tenants
If you need to override some of the default URL endpoints, you can use these
environment variables:

```sh
export MICROSOFT_AUTHORIZE_URL=https://login.microsoftonline.com/<your_tenant_id>/oauth2/v2.0/authorize
export MICROSOFT_TOKEN_URL=https://login.microsoftonline.com/<your_tenant_id>/oauth2/v2.0/token
export MICROSOFT_PROFILE_URL=...
```

or alternatively change your `config/runtime.exs` file to include 
your custom endpoints

```elixir
config :elixir_auth_microsoft,
  #...
  authorize_url: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<your_tenant_id>/oauth2/v2.0/authorize",
  token_url: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<your_tenant_id>/oauth2/v2.0/token",
  profile_url: ...
```

If you are using "Accounts in this organizational directory only 
(Default Directory only - Single tenant)" for "Supported account types" 
in your Azure AD application setup you must override the `MICROSOFT_AUTHORIZE_URL` 
and `MICROSOFT_TOKEN_URL` environment variables to include your tenant ID as shown 
above, or else you will get an `unauthorized_client` error, or an `AADSTS500202` error.

> **Warning**
>
> If you don't override the `authorize_url` and `token_url` parameters
> *and* have the app registration open for users,
> you *may* encounter an error:
>
> `ErrorInsufficientPermissionsInAccessToken - "Exception of type 'Microsoft.Fast.Profile.Core.Exception.ProfileAccessDeniedException' was thrown."`
>
> If this occurs, you need to override the `authorize_url` and `token_url`
> with your `tenant_id`, as shown above.

## 4. Add a "Sign in with Microsoft" Button to your App

Add a "Sign in with Microsoft" 
to the template 
where you want to display it:

```html
<a href={@oauth_microsoft_url}>
  <img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/media/howto-add-branding-in-azure-ad-apps/ms-symbollockup_signin_light.png" alt="Sign in with Microsoft" />
</a>
```

To enable this button you need to 
generate the valid signin URL in the controller 
that is responsible for this page
using
`ElixirAuthMicrosoft.generate_oauth_url_authorize/2`

e.g:

```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
  oauth_microsoft_url = ElixirAuthMicrosoft.generate_oauth_url_authorize(conn, "random_uuid_here")
  render(conn, "index.html",[oauth_microsoft_url: oauth_microsoft_url])
end
```

> **Note**: this is covered in the 
[/**demo**/README.md](/demo/README.md).

## 5. Use the Built-in Functions to Authenticate People :shipit: 

Once you have the necessary environment or config variables
in your `Elixir`/`Phoenix` App, 
use the 
`ElixirAuthMicrosoft.get_token/2` 
and 
`ElixirAuthMicrosoft.get_user_profile`
functions to handle authentication.

Sample controller code:

```elixir
defmodule AppWeb.MicrosoftAuthController do
  use AppWeb, :controller

  @doc """
  `index/2` handles the callback from Microsoft Auth API redirect.
  """
  def index(conn, %{"code" => code, "state" => state}) do

    # Perform state change here (to prevent CSRF)
    if state !== "random_state_uid" do
      # error handling
    end

    {:ok, token} = ElixirAuthMicrosoft.get_token(code, conn)
    {:ok, profile} = ElixirAuthMicrosoft.get_user_profile(token.access_token)

    conn
    |> put_view(AppWeb.PageView)
    |> render(:welcome, profile: profile)
  end
end
```

The exact controller code implementation is up to you,üéâ
but we have provided a working example.

## 6. Add the `/auth/microsoft/callback` to `router.ex`

Open your `lib/app_web/router.ex` file
and locate the section that looks like `scope "/", AppWeb do`

Add the following line:

```elixir
get "/auth/microsoft/callback", MicrosoftAuthController, :index
```

With all that hooked up you should now have everything working.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can define your callback path with an environment variable
> `MICROSOFT_CALLBACK_PATH` 
> or by using the config property `:callback_path` in your config files.

### 6.1 Give it a try!

The home page of the app 
should now have a big 
"Sign in with Microsoft" button:

![elixir-auth-microsoft-demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/196782404-0918edf9-65e1-4a4d-b676-31bd10b8cd42.png)

When the person clicks the "**Sign in with Microsoft**" button, 
they should be prompted
with the Microsoft Sign-in page:

![demo-signin-page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/196753149-c7af146e-cee8-4c2d-b4fc-9c6fb73f339a.png)

This makes it clear what App they are authenticating with,
in our case **`elixir-auth-microsoft-demo`**
(_your app will be whatever you called it!_)

The person will then have to consent to the defined scopes
in the App Registration alongside the overlap of the scope(s)
requested.

After this, they will be shown the following page
after successful login:

![auth-success-welcome](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/196753288-31b1ddd3-8e4e-40e6-bf7d-35214a05c546.png)


## 7. Logging the person out

The same way you can log a person in,
you should let them logout.
This package will do two things:

- redirect the person to the `Microsoft` logout page.
This is to end the person's session on `Microsoft`'s identity platform.
- clear the app's cookies/session on the client.

In order to add logout capabilities to your application,
you need to:

- add the **redirect URI to your Azure app registration `Redirect URIs` settings**.

<img width="1260" alt="add_azure" src="https://github.com/LuchoTurtle/banger-bot/assets/17494745/07f04dab-f48d-4c36-89dc-e8c70f4eaa02">


- optionally, define the `redirect URI` the person will be redirected to
after successfully logging out. 
This can be the homepage of your application, for example.
If this is not set, no redirection occurs.
*However*, setting this option is **highly recommended**
because it will clear the person's session data locally.


### 7.1 Setting up the post-logout redirect URI

So, for this,
you need to set the `MICROSOFT_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI` env variable
(or add it to the `:post_logout_redirect_uri` parameter 
in the app's `config`).

```
export MICROSOFT_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:4000/auth/microsoft/logout
```

Inside the `router.ex` file,
we'll need to add the redirect URI to the scope.

```elixir
  scope "/", AppWeb do
    pipe_through :browser

    get "/", PageController, :index
    get "/auth/microsoft/callback", MicrosoftAuthController, :index
    get "/auth/microsoft/logout", MicrosoftAuthController, :logout  # add this
  end
```

And then define the behaviour inside your 
`MicrosoftAuthController`.

```elixir
  def logout(conn, _params) do

    # Clears token from user session
    conn = conn |> delete_session(:token)

    conn
    |> redirect(to: "/")
  end
```

This will delete the session locally
*after* the person signs out from `Microsoft`.

### 7.2 Add button for person to log out

After this setup,
all you need to do is use the 
`ElixirAuthMicrosoft.generate_oauth_url_logout()` function
to generate the link the person should be redirected to
after clicking the `Sign Out` button.

## _Done_! 

That's it!
You can chose to do whatever you want after this point.
If you have any questions or get stuck,
please

If you find this package/repo _useful_,
please star on GitHub, 
so that we know! ‚≠ê 

Thank you! üôè 

<br />


## Testing 

If you want pre-defined responses without making real requests
when testing,
you can add the following property `httpoison_mock`
in your `test.exs` configuration file.

```elixir
config :elixir_auth_microsoft,
  httpoison_mock: true
```

With this setting turned on, 
calls will return successful requests 
with mock data.

Of course, you could always a mocking library like
[`mox`](https://github.com/dashbitco/mox)
for this. 
But if you want a quick way to test your app with this package,
this option may be for you!


## Complete Working Demo / Example `Phoenix` App üöÄ

If you get stuck 
or need a more in-depth / real-world implementation,
we've created a guide that takes you step-by-step 
through creating a `Phoenix` app with
Microsoft authentication.

Please see: 
[/**demo**/README.md](/demo/README.md).

<br />


## Optimised SVG + CSS Button

If you inspect our [demo](./demo/) app, 
you might have realised we are using an `<img>` for the 
`Sign in with Microsoft` button. 

However, we could go for an alternative and have a `svg` 
file, making it more lightweight and allowing us to even
change languages if we wanted to!

Luckily, Microsoft has made all the heavylifting for us. 
If we follow this [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-add-branding-in-azure-ad-apps#pictogram-and-sign-in-with-microsoft),
we'll find a few options and themes on SVG format.

The result looks _better_ than the `<img>` button. 
Here's a comparison between the two:


<img width="1306" alt="two_buttons" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/196441338-8c46d7d0-8fbc-4515-9f0a-591faaa63c47.png">

## Branding Guidelines

The official Microsoft Auth branding guidelines specify exact button, font and spacing:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-add-branding-in-azure-ad-apps
